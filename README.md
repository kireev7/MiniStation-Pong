# MiniStation-Pong
Hi everyone, recently I wanted to do something interesting with a microcontroller in the gaming industry. So I came to the conclusion that I want to make a game console. For the basic microcontroller I took Atmega 328p. It has 32 KB of memory, so even heavy games can go on it without any problems.
