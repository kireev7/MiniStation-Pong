# MiniStation-Pong
Hi everyone, recently I wanted to do something interesting with a microcontroller in the gaming industry(some simple). So I came to the conclusion that I want to make a game console. For the basic microcontroller I took Atmega 328p. It has 32 KB of memory, so even heavy games can go on it without any problems. So I took a microcontroller, two 22 pf capacitors, a 16 MHz quartz resonator, 2 potentiometers and wires. And I made the following scheme:

Instead of a mini USB, you can connect a 5 volt power supply from the Arduino. As a result, you should get the following: (folded on the breadboard)
